## Introduction
This site contains the project documentation for the
`Functions` project which is part of CMSE 890-402 assignment.
Its aim is to give you a framework to build your
project documentation using Python, MkDocs,
mkdocstrings, and the Material for MkDocs theme.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.

## Acknowledgements

I want to thank Dr. Andrew Fullard for being a great teacher.

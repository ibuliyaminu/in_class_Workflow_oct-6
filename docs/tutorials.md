This part of the project documentation focuses on a
**learning-oriented** approach. You'll learn how to
get started with the code in this project.

After you have downloaded python software on you device. You can read this tutorial for better understanding of this project. Here are certain things you should be familiar with.

 1. Function Definition:
The code starts by defining a Python function which is a block of code which only runs when it is called. For example, a function named "my_thermo_stat" that takes two parameters: 'temp' and 'desired_temp'.

2. Docstring:
A docstring is used as a comment within triple quotes ("""). It describes the purpose of the function, its inputs (width and height), for example, as in the function "area_of_rectangle" and the expected output (out). Additionally, it indicates the expected types for the inputs and the return type.

3. Variable Initialization:
A variable can be initialized to 0. This initialized variable will be used to track whether, for example, the string contains digits (1 if it does, 0 if it doesn't).

4. Loop through the String:
Functions use a 'for' loop to iterate over, for example, each character in the input string (s).

4. Return Statement:
The function returns the determined status (status) based on the temperature comparison.

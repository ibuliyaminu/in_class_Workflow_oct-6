This part of the project documentation focuses on
an **information-oriented** approach. Use it as a
reference for the technical implementation of the
`functions` project code.

This is the first documentation practice as an in-class assignment. This documentation decribes five different functions including have_digit, my_adder, my_thermo_stat, perimeter_of_rectangle, and area_of_rectangle.

For example, function 'my_adder' starts by defining a finction that takes three parameters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 
using the assignment syntax, values are assigned to the variables. The codes calculate the sum of the variables.
